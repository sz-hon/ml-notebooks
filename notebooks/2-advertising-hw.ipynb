    "The dataset is described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Suppose that we are statistical consultants hired by a client to provide advice on how to improve sales of a particular product. The `Advertising` data set consists of the sales of that product in 200 different markets, along with advertising budgets for the product in each of those markets for three different media: TV, radio, and newspaper.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> …\n",
    ">\n",
    "> It is not possible for our client to directly increase sales of the product. On the other hand, they can control the advertising expenditure in each of the three media. Therefore, if we determine that there is an association between advertising and sales, then we can instruct our client to adjust advertising budgets, thereby indirectly increasing sales. In other words, our goal is to develop an accurate model that can be used to predict sales on the basis of the three media budgets.\n",
